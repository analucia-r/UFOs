# UFOs

# Overview of the Analysis 
In this analysis a webpage was created and filters were inputed to extract specific information such as Date, City, State, Country and Shape which made it possible for multple critiera to be searched for at the same time. By using both HTML and Javascript the code was modified in the index.html file, when updated it created new filters on the UFO webpage. Headers, summaries and small sections of informaiton were also created in this challenge regarding to UFO sighting. 

# Results 
- The list element that creates the button was previously created in the practice but later removed. 
- Five new list were created as filters on the index.html files 
- The table was rebuilt using the filtered data buildTable(filteredData); which was defined previosly on the code in step 8. Using let filteredData = tableData; using the function "let" where it declares the variable in javascript.  
- The tableData was defined from the data used in the data.js file using const.

# Summary 
 Drawback: Lower-case spelling is necessary for the search, this might depend on the data set provided. User must know specific dates for what they are looking for. 
 
 Recommendations: Allow both upper and lower case letters when doing the search. Adding a filter to search by range of month or year. There might be a certain time of the year where UFO's sightings are more likely and the user can have a wider range to study and find information on.
